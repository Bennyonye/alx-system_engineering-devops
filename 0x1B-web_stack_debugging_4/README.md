# Web Stack Debugging #4

This project is part of a series focused on web stack debugging. In each of these projects, I was provided with a broken or bugged web stack within an isolated container and tasked with restoring it to a functional state. For every task, I developed a script to automate the necessary commands to fix the issues.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

### 1. **Sky is the Limit: Let's Push It Higher**
   - **File:** [0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp](./0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp)
   - **Description:** A Puppet manifest that optimizes the Apache web server's configuration to handle increased traffic more efficiently.

### 2. **User Limit**
   - **File:** [1-user_limit.pp](./1-user_limit.pp)
   - **Description:** A Puppet manifest that modifies the OS configuration to allow the user `holberton` to log in and open files without encountering errors.

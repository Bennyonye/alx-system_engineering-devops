# SSH Management

This project focuses on SSH (Secure Shell) protocol usage for server connectivity and operations on an ALX-provided server.

## Task Overview

* **0. Using a Private Key**
  * [0-use_a_private_key](./0-use_a_private_key): Bash script that facilitates SSH connection to the ALX-provided server using a private key.

* **1. Creating an SSH Key Pair**
  * [1-create_ssh_key_pair](./1-create_ssh_key_pair): Bash script to generate an RSA key pair for SSH authentication.

* **2. Client Configuration File**
  * [2-ssh_config](./2-ssh_config): SSH configuration file designed to utilize the `~/.ssh/school` private key and disable password-based authentication.

These tasks empower efficient and secure management of server connections and configurations via SSH protocol.

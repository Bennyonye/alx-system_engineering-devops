# What Happens When You Type google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter

As a Fullstack Software Engineer, understanding the web 2.0 infrastructure is crucial. In this blog post, we'll dive into the intricacies of what happens behind the scenes when you type a URL like `google.com` into your browser and hit Enter.

## DNS Request

The process begins with a DNS (Domain Name System) request. When you type `google.com`, your browser sends a DNS query to a DNS resolver to translate the human-readable domain name into an IP address. This step is essential because computers communicate with each other using IP addresses, not domain names.

## TCP/IP

Once the DNS resolver returns the IP address of `google.com`, your browser initiates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection with the corresponding web server using the retrieved IP address. TCP ensures reliable and ordered communication between the client (your browser) and the server (Google's server).

## Firewall

Before reaching the web server, the TCP connection may pass through a firewall. Firewalls are security measures that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They act as a barrier between your computer and potential threats from the internet.

## HTTPS/SSL

Next, the browser establishes an encrypted HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) connection with the web server. This encryption is facilitated by SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security). HTTPS encrypts the data transmitted between the client and server, ensuring privacy and security during communication.

## Load Balancer

Large websites like Google typically use load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple web servers. Load balancers enhance the performance, reliability, and scalability of web applications by evenly distributing requests and preventing any single server from becoming overwhelmed.

## Web Server

Once the request reaches the web server, it processes the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request sent by the browser. The web server retrieves the requested web page or resources, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or images, from its file system or generates dynamic content based on the request.

## Application Server

In some cases, the web server forwards requests requiring dynamic content or data processing to an application server. The application server executes the necessary logic, retrieves data from databases or external APIs, and generates the appropriate response. This separation of concerns between web and application servers helps maintain a scalable and maintainable architecture.

## Database

If the request involves retrieving or manipulating data stored in a database, the application server interacts with the database server. The database server processes SQL queries, retrieves or updates data in the database, and returns the results to the application server. This interaction enables dynamic content generation and personalized user experiences.

In conclusion, typing a URL into your browser and pressing Enter triggers a complex sequence of events involving DNS resolution, TCP/IP communication, security measures like firewalls and HTTPS, load balancing for scalability, web servers for content delivery, application servers for dynamic content generation, and databases for data retrieval and storage. Understanding this process is fundamental for Fullstack Software Engineers to build robust and efficient web applications.
